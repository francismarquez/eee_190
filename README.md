# Abstract
Ranking highest among the leading causes of mortality both in the Philippines and worldwide are cardiovascular diseases (CVD). It is through a non-invasive diagnostic procedure called electrocardiography (ECG) can a patient's general cardiac condition be observed, which when paired with an early and accurate diagnosis could bring significant chances for successful treatment. However, ECG analysis is still heavily reliant on manual interpretation of experienced medical practitioners. Even automated ECG machines accessible to higher-end hospitals require systematic over-reading by clinicians failing its attempt to alleviate the load on the already disadvantaged ratio of specialized physicians to patients. Tackling this challenge and leveraging both advancements in deep learning techniques and on-device inference frameworks, this paper proposes to develop a smartphone application capable of accepting raw ECG data as input and perform on-device inference to give an accurate ECG diagnosis as an output. With this approach, inference wouldn't require internet connectivity, would reduce latency, and assure data privacy. Using TensorFlow a ResNet architecture with 11 convolutional layers is implemented and trained. Performance of this model is then compared with that of an optimized model generated using Tensorflow Lite. Preliminary findings show an approximately 90\% file size reduction of the original model while still performing a high of 0.93 AUC score.
